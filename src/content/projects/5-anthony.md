## Project
Anthony App specializes in smart parking solutions, including autonomous traffic and parking management systems with AI-based detection and real-time license plate recognition. This experience allowed me to enhance my technical skills and contribute to the development of a robust and efficient web application.<br>
During my time at Anthony App, I worked as a full stack developer, where we started the development of a project "from scratch" using technologies like Node.js, Quasar Framework, Vue.js, MikroORM, and Fastify. <br>
