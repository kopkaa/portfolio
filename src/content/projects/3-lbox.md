## Project
During my time at LinuxBox, I completed my bachelorâ€™s thesis, where I worked on a component of the CRM system, focusing on the implementation of a web chat feature. This involved designing, analyzing, and implementing real-time communication capabilities for connecting website visitors with support agents.<br>
