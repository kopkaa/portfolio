  I contributed to developing a tool for document management and electronic signing. My role involved working on the backend using Node.js (TypeScript) and later transitioning to Kotlin with the Micronaut framework.<br> On the frontend, I utilized Vue.js with TypeScript and communicated with the backend via REST API. The project leveraged PostgreSQL databases, and for version control, we used Git with Bitbucket.<br>I also gained experience with Docker, AWS and Terraform throughout the project.
