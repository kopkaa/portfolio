## YdealAppCloud

The task was to create a modern, secure, and responsive client zone application that provides clients with a view of their portfolio while also enabling them to finalize and sign contractual documents fully online.

We created multi-tenant application for signing and sending PDFs documents. Each tenant can have his own branding.
