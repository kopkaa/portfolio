## YdealAppCloud

The task was to create a modern, secure, and responsive client zone application that provides clients with a view of their portfolio while also enabling them to finalize and sign contractual documents fully online.

We created multi-tenant application for signing and sending PDFs documents. Each tenant can have his own branding.

### My role

I contributed to this project as a full-stack developer, focusing on both frontend and backend development. On the frontend, I built dynamic components using Vue.js with the Quasar framework, ensuring a seamless user experience. For the backend, I designed and implemented RESTful APIs using Kotlin and the Micronaut frameworks. Additionally, I managed integrations with various third-party APIs, including Raynet, Keycloak, and BankID, to ensure secure authentication and smooth data exchange.
