## Node.js Developer at IceWarp

As a backend developer at IceWarp, I work on designing, developing, and maintaining modern microservices built with Node.js. These services are part of a large, distributed system that powers IceWarp's secure cloud-based communication and collaboration platform, including email, calendars, file sharing, and third-party integrations like Office 365 and Google Workspace.
