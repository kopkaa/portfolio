  Bonu.sk is a web platform that serves as an aggregator for various discount offers and benefits for users.<br>
  As a frontend developer on the project, I focused on creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces. <br> The use of Nuxt 3's server-side rendering capabilities helped improve SEO and initial page load times, while TypeScript provided static type checking to minimize errors and improve code quality throughout the development process.
